<p align="center"><i>Exploration, Research, Discovery</i> - a <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/64798">Campfire</a>-based mod for Skyrim</p>

### Main Ideas
 - Exploration (dungeons & random wandering) rewards you with Relics
 - Different types of Relics yield different rewards
 - Which ones you find depends on your skills (e.g. mages will get more magic-related ones)
 - Research (at a camp) needed to unlock these secrets
 - As you level your skills (perk trees) up, you'll gain access to more abilities, more relics, etc.
 - Different relic sizes: minor (leveled loot), normal and ancient (hand-placed)
